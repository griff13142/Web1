# Web1
Web Programming
The Project.html is just code put togethere that we agreed upon from our text papers I asked you to fill out. 

The  Web2 is the templet we would like to try to follow when creating our website. 

The goal is to create a website that Is selling our IT skills for set prices per hour. 
We will link our personal websites to it and our Linkedin or someother  job finder website profile. 

This is my first time using GitHub so if I am not doing something right or not allowing access to something please let me know. 

                                      Ignore the Final Web 4300 (2.0) folder.
